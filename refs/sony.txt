INTRODUCTION
Since 2000, Sony has been working on developing Digital Motion Picture Camera
systems for the industry under the “CineAlta” line for more than 20 years. Starting
with the first CineAlta camera HDW-F900, many models have been introduced to
the market until now.
During the period, Sony developed a lot of key technologies such as 24p, RGB444
system, Super35mm image sensor, 4K and 8K high resolution. These have been
contributing to the high-end content creation market such as feature film, TV
drama and commercials.
In 2017, we launched the latest cinema camera VENICE equipped with 36x24 Full-
Frame CMOS image sensor specifically designed for high-end cinematography. We
evolved and launched the successor VENICE 2 in 2022, reflecting various requests
received from the market. Then, BURANO has been launched in 2024 as a new
addition to CineAlta family – that is ideal for single-camera operators and small
crews.
This document provides an overview of the CineAlta workflow that has already
been utilized by many users – explaining how to work with the latest models
VENICE 2 and BURANO. The content is planned to be continuously updated as
necessary.

36x24mm Full-Frame Sensor for Cinema
VENICE 2 (8K/6K) features one of two 36x24mm full-frame image sensors,
designed specifically for the demands and performance of high-end cinematography.
Each offers remarkable sensitivity, latitude and color rendition, and because the
sensor blocks are interchangeable, users can easily switch between sensors—without
any extra firmware—and can even use the sensor from their original VENICE.
The new 8K sensor can capture images up to a maximum pixels of 8640 x 5760,
while the established 6K sensor offers up to 6048 x 4032. Both offer powerful
oversampling for incredible 4K images.
• Full-Frame full width 36mm 8K and 6K
In full-frame, you can use the full width of the sensors (8640 or 6048 pixels)
for widescreen spherical 2.39:1 or Large Format Scope. Full-Frame can be
used creatively in several ways – for example, to allow for extra shallow depth
of field or super-wide shooting.
• Super35 full height 2.0x squeeze anamorphic
For anamorphic shooting and production, Super35 full height 2x squeeze
anamorphic is supported.
• Super35 17:9 and 16:9
These popular imager modes have native support in VENICE 2, and the 8K
sensor makes it possible to capture 5.8K footage in these modes. Current
Super35mm PL mount lenses can be used as well.

BURANO also has a large 36x24mm full-frame image sensor that delivers high-
quality images and superb rendition with wide latitude and a rich color gamut. It
achieves the beautiful bokeh and wide-angle shooting that only a full-frame sensor
can provide.
8K image quality with a maximum pixels of 8632 x 4856 and, through oversampling,
it can output high-quality 4K content.

9
6K 17:9/16:9 Full-Frame crop mode on BURANO
This is one of the most popular imager scan modes on BURANO. Because it can bring
the following benefits at the same time :
- Superior image quality with near FF 8.6K scan down-sampled to 6K for recording
(only about 1.07x crop)
- Smaller file size (compared to FF 8.6K scan)
- Higher frame rate (up to 60 fps)

10
Fast readout with stacked CMOS structure
VENICE 2 and BURANO have equipped a newly developed memory-integrated Full-
Frame CMOS sensor dedicated for cinema camera.
By adopting a “stacked structure” that allows the high-speed signal processing circuit
to be placed in a separate layer from the pixel area, the processing circuit section
has been greatly expanded, and the speed of signal processing has improved
dramatically.
Furthermore, an integral memory is mounted on the back of the sensor. The sensor
outputs a large amount of signals, which are temporarily stored in the integral
memory to prevent congestion. This innovative sensor structure has achieved a data
readout speed much faster than the conventional back-illuminated CMOS sensor.
The stacked CMOS sensors dramatically reduce the motion distortion (rolling
shutter effect) that often occurs when capturing fast-moving subjects. By scanning
the entire pixel area from top to bottom at high speed, the timing difference in
readout between the top and bottom of the image is minimized.

11
In fact, the readout speed of CMOS sensor varies depending on image scan mode.
For shooting situation on BURANO where the rolling shutter performance is critical,
we would recommend using 4K 17:9 Super35 crop and 3.8K 16:9 Full Frame
crop* image scan modes that offer relatively fast readout speed on this model.
*Planned to support on Ver 2.0 (March 2025 or later)

12
Dual Base ISO
Digital imaging sensors perform best when EI (Exposure Index) is set to their native,
Base ISO. It’s at this Base ISO value you will realize a very clean image with the best
balance of good signal to noise ratio and wide dynamic range. This is because at the
Base ISO setting, there is no amplification, or gain (voltage), being added to the
signal coming from the sensor.
Therefore, both VENICE 2 and BURANO camera’s full-frame sensor has what is
termed Dual Base ISO. It means that the camera’s imaging sensor has two distinct
sensitivities to light – one LOW at ISO 800* for higher light levels, and one HIGH at
ISO 3200* for lower light levels.

13
At each Base ISO level, since there is no such amplification being added to the signal
as explained above, the sensor captures the same, clean image. And as illustrated in
the graph below, at each Base ISO, the sensor also captures same wide dynamic
range with an equivalent ratio of stops of latitude above and below 18% grey – a
total of 16 stops*.
*In case of VENICE 2 (8K) and BURANO
Dual Base ISO, and high Base ISO specifically, also pay dividends when it comes to
High Frame Rate (HFR) shooting. Indeed, for HFR, sensitivity is a critical factor since
each frame is exposed to light for an even shorter duration. As such, having a high
Base ISO option of 3200 EI ensures high image quality even when shooting under
more modest lighting packages.

16
BURANO
This feature, this flexibility, greatly expands the creative options and practical
applications available to cinematographers. So whether you are shooting slower
anamorphic lenses in low light, or faster spherical lenses with low levels of practical
lighting, or during the day on location under brighter conditions and using Internal
ND of VENICE 2 or BURANO, Dual Base ISO makes it easier to achieve clean images
with a very wide dynamic range in wide range of lighting conditions.

17
S-Log3 / S-Gamut3
The evolution of camera technology means that the sensors in modern cameras are
now capable of matching, or even surpassing, the quality of 35mm film.
The problem is that existing video formats don’t support the vast amount of
information captured by a modern camera sensor. The result : reduced dynamic
range and color information.
S-Log3 is a tonal curve designed to record and transmit as much of the information
recorded by your camera’s sensor as possible. S-Log3 breathes life into your images
by preserving dynamic range recorded by the sensor. Then in post-production, you
create the image you want as part of the grading process, with greater artistic control
over the finished product.
S-Log3 is best balanced tonal curve for Sony’s image sensors to achieve low noise,
shadow reproduction, rich mid-tones and high dynamic range.

18
Both VENICE 2 and BURANO support two color grading spaces – “S-Log3 / S-
Gamut3.Cine” and “S-Log3 / S-Gamut3”.
S-Gamut3.Cine is similar to native film scan which was used for TV production, film
out digital cinema. Color reproduction is designed slightly wider than DCI-P3 to
provide ample room for grading. The combination of S-Log3 and S-Gamut3.Cine
have good compatibility with Cineon workflow.
S-Gamut3 is a wider color space than S-Gamut3.Cine. It is best for ACES, ITU-R
BT.2020 (Rec.2020) and camera data archiving use, as 8/10/12 bit code value.
This color space is designed to support wide gamut displays while maintaining bit
precision at the same time. It entirely covers ACES Primary 1 (AP1) and Rec.2020
wide color gamut.

19
S-Log3 encoding in ProRes files (VENICE 2) and XAVC files (BURANO) is defined as
Full range. This is based on Sony’s design concept that S-Log3 should be handled
in Full range so that it can offer best performance of image quality – which is common
not only to CineAlta but to all the other cameras.
However, in response to customer feedback that some external devices (such as LUT
boxes) need to receive the SDI output signal from the camera as Legal range,
VENICE 2 (Ver 3.0 or later) provides an option to output a compressed signal as
Legal range – by setting [LUT Select] menu to [Log(Legal)].
When [Log] is selected in the menu, S-Log3 signal is output as Full range. This
setting is available for applying to SDI 1/2, SDI 3/4, or Monitor output independently.
As for BURANO, S-Log3 signal is always output as Full range, meaning there is no
option to output a compressed signal as Legal range.

Look
s709 Overview
S-Log3 / S-Gamut3.Cine or S-Gamut3 provide huge dynamic range and color space
capabilities within the camera that can be used to capture material, that provides
post-production with the widest creative freedom and control.
However for those working on-set, in dailies and in post-production, some solution
is required in order to review materials shot in S-Log3 / S-Gamut3.Cine or S-Gamut3
on a standard monitor – designed to operate in conventional Rec.709 dynamic range
and color space.
Sony has introduced a series of looks as LUTs (Look Up Tables) for on-set monitoring
while shooting, and for clip review afterwards.
The conventional monitor look 709(800%) integrated into F65 and PMW-F55
cameras has a high contrast tone curve and renders high saturated, vivid colors.
With the introduction of VENICE, 709(800%) has been renamed as “R709”.
Sony has also developed an original monitor look called “s709”. This renders imagery
in subtle colors, with smooth color gradation and a softer low contrast tone curve –
suitable for cinema and drama productions.
s709 is close to the film color characteristics and allows directors, DOPs and
cinematographers, to have the final film look on location and while shooting.

21

22
s709 Characteristics
s709 :
s709 positions in the “low contrast” and “cinematic color” region in the right
contrast-color chart. This look provides subtle and well-rendered facial tints, with a
tone curve close to film characteristics, and low contrast.
R709(800%) :
This look provides high contrast with broadcast colors. With the introduction of
VENICE this look has been renamed from “709(800)”.
LC-709*, LC-709 Type A* :
These look profiles provide low contrast with broadcast color.
Cine+709* :
Subtle colors, with high contrast and a tone curve close to film characteristics.
*No preset on VENICE 2 / BURANO. Those can be applied on RAW Viewer.
It is recommended that s709 is used for cinema and television drama production,
while R709 is used for monitoring images that are closer to the actual look with
high contrast compared to those of s709.

23
s709 has a low contrast tone curve to deliver soft tonal look in the image. The
shadows and midtones have relatively natural responses, while the highlights are
compressed to preserve wide latitude in the camera, and specular highlights in the
scene.
The diagrams below compare s709 and R709(800%) tone curves. s709 has a lower
contrast curve than R709(800%), and preserves highlights.
s709 has a softer low saturated image, and renders colors closer to those of film
characters. It delivers soft and subtle skin tones with smooth gradation.
The s709 cube is optimized for a Rec.709 monitor. If you use the look with a P3
monitoring device (e.g. projector) at a post-production house, please use one of the
following P3 cubes that is appropriate for the white point of your projector.
These can be used for S-Log3 / S-Gamut3.Cine, and are available to download from
LUT Downloads Page

s709 Workflow
This diagram below shows the basic principles and capabilities behind creating
production workflows using the camera’s integrated s709 functionality available from
SDI output, and 3D LUTs like the s709.cube and sP3Dxx.cube files. Many different
combinations of this basic example can be used for different shooting and production
scenarios.

25
The diagram below shows an example of a workflow through the dailies/editorial
phase and the grading phase of a typical production.
It shows how s709 can be used for direct viewing on-set by using the direct output
from VENICE, as described before.
S-Log3 provides excellent dynamic range for post-production as is used as a standard
within the post-production tools. S-Gamut3.Cine provides a wide color space post-
production. Working with S-Gamut3.Cine/S-Log3 material offers huge creative
possibilities in post-production.
Dailies/Editorial can use s709 to create Rec.709 proxy clips for fast review and editing.
Later in the production workflow, in grading, s709 can also be used to provide a view
of the S-Gamut3.Cine/S-Log3 material on a standard Rec.709 monitor.

26
Selecting whether the s709.cube is used as an input LUT or output LUT will depend
on the grading style. If the grade is in log space, then the s709.cube should be
applied as an output LUT. If the grade is in Rec.709 space, then the s709.cube should
be applied as an input LUT.
If your grading target is P3, apply one of the .cube file for P3DCI or P3D65 depending
on the target white, instead of the s709.cube.
Viewing s709 on camera
s709 output is available via SDI output on VENICE 2 / BURANO, which can be used
as a standard on-set monitoring look for shooting.
As an example on VENICE 2, look control on SDI 1/2, SDI 3/4, Monitor, HDMI
outputs and Viewfinder is available by pressing ITEM key 5, in the HOME screen on
Sub Display.

27
Using s709 on Sony RAW Viewer
Sony RAW Viewer is a viewer application software for Windows / Mac OS platform,
which can handle X-OCN, XAVC and other files recorded by VENICE 2 / BURANO.
Open the footage and in the Parameter Setting window :
• Select [S-Gamut3.Cine/S-Log3] in [Grading Color Space] setting
• To apply s709 as input LUT, select [s709] in [Look Profile] setting
• To apply s709 as output LUT, select [s709] in [Monitor LUT] setting

28
LUT Downloads Page
Here 
is the web page where you can download a wide variety of LUTs free of
charge – suitable for Sony CineAlta cameras.
VENICE 2 / BURANO can import 17-grid, 33-grid or 65-grid* 3D LUT files in CUBE
format (.cube) by using an SD card – created using Sony RAW Viewer, Blackmagic
Design DaVinci Resolve or other tools.
LUT files with other lattice sizes can be used after conversion in Sony Catalyst
Browse/Prepare application software.
*Only VENICE 2 can import 65-grid User 3D LUT files, but when it’s loaded the SDI signal is output
with 33-grid LUT data applied
ART (Advanced Rendering Transform)
They are pretty well understood by most people and are generally used by sharing
the LUT amongst the DIT and other camera staff to load into the camera.
However, 3D LUTs have some limitation in terms of accuracy depending on the
number of grids. Even in a full post-production suite, they all work by using
interpolation between the known points, so the results are imperfect, the more
grids the more accurate.
This requires vast hardware resources (think of the size of a modern GPU graphic
card), so it is neither practical nor possible to process the larger patterns within a
battery powered camera. As a result, banding and highlight sparkle might be seen
on the camera output in some cases (see Picture 1).
On set, many DIT’s and DP’s wonder why they can see some banding and highlight
sparkle effects and are concerned that this may affect the recording as well. In
practice the recording is perfect.
In order to overcome these limitations, you can either increase the number of
calculations of stored matrix points, with the associated massive increase in
hardware requirements, or choose to use the data in another way by converting it
to a format that allows us to use the information as part of the video processing.

29
ART (Advanced Rendering Transform) fully controls internal hardware modules
at bit level precision and makes the most out of the hardware capabilities. The
result of using the .ART file are shown below in Picture 2.
You can easily notice a massive improvement in the image, remembering this is
about as tricky a source that you can find.

30
ART file workflow :
1. Prepare 3D .cube file with grading tools or RAW Viewer
2. Import 3D .cube file into RAW Viewer, and export .art file
3. Import .art file to VENICE 2 by using an SD card

31
Recording Format (X-OCN)
In 2016, Sony has released new recording format X-OCN (eXtended tonal range
Original Camera Negative) – that is Sony’s original compressed RAW format.
This format further enhances the compression efficiency of Sony RAW, which
delivers visually loss-less image quality.
X-OCN offers uncompromising image capture performance with the power of 16
bits, at low data rates. It processes camera original image data by utilizing a
unique algorithm from Sony.
By combining superlative 16-bit precision with surprisingly moderate bit rates, X-
OCN opens up powerful new production possibilities. X-OCN produces file sizes much
smaller than typical camera RAW, but unlike conventional codecs, X-OCN offers 16-
bit scene linear encoding. So, you get the ultimate in tonal expression, longer
recording times, faster file transfers and more economical post-production.
VENICE 2 and BURANO build upon X-OCN’s proven success by offering internal 16-
bit X-OCN recording without need for an external recorder, dramatically shrinking
the form factor while still offering the full dynamic range and color reproduction of
the sensor.
Far exceeding 10 and 12-bit formats, 16-bit X-OCN records 65,536 tonal gradations
per color component, or over 280 trillion individual shades of color. This is the
ultimate in grayscale expression, creating an enormous palette for extreme subtleties
in grading and far greater flexibility for colorists and editors alike.

32
In most cases such as Feature Film, TV Drama or Commercial, Sony would
recommend X-OCN ST which provides best balance between picture quality and file
transfer time / storage size.
For special cases such as visual effects work or contents creation for giant screen,
X-OCN XT is ideal as it captures the highest quality imagery.
For Mid-Low budget cinema (including TV Drama), Documentary or productions
requiring long recording time, X-OCN LT is a good option as it provides even smaller
file size than X-OCN ST – while preserving the benefit of 16-bit scene linear.

33
The following bar charts show how the bitrate of X-OCN (Sony’s original
compressed RAW) is compared to other formats at 4K/24p and 8K/24p.
When it comes to 4K X-OCN LT (389Mbps), it can offer stunning RAW quality with
16-bit scene linear at almost equivalent bitrate to 4K XAVC Class480 (384Mbps)
and even at lower bitrate than 4K ProRes 422 (503Mbps).
Bitrate Comparison at 4096 x 2160 / 24p
Bitrate Comparison at 8192 x 4320 / 24p
X-OCN (Sony’s original compressed RAW format) gives you all the benefits of a RAW
workflow but without huge file sizes normally associated with uncompressed RAW.
It takes everything that the sensor captures and uses a clever encoding process to
store that information in a user friendly, compact, 16-bit MXF file.

34
Recording Media (AXS / CFexpress Memory Card)
AXS Memory Card (for VENICE 2)
In 2014, Sony has released AXS Memory Card (A Series) which is ideal for X-OCN
recording with CineAlta cameras. Perfectly suited to the highest quality
cinematography, AXS Memory has a unique combination of capacity, sustained data
throughput, security and portability. It opens up completely new ways for end-users
to work.
Together with the launch of VENICE 2, the new AXS-1TS66 memory card was
added to the line-up – which has a capacity of 1 TB and guaranteed write speed of
6.6 Gbps. It can record up to 8.6K using 16-bit X-OCN format, as well as supporting
a range of frame rates at lower resolutions. It can also handle 4K ProRes and High
Frame Rate (HFR) 4K recording up to 120fps*.
*HFR up to 120fps in 4K resolution is only supported by VENICE 2 with 6K sensor
AXS Memory Card – A Series have 3 types. The maximum of shooting frame rate on
VENICE 2 varies depending on the speed performance of AXS Memory Card.

35
Note
Please keep the memory card in the supplied card case when storing or carrying it,
and make sure that the case is locked securely – in order to prevent any damage
which may result in the loss of recorded data.
The AXS-AR3 card reader offers an incredible maximum data read speed of up to
9.6 Gbps (1200 MB/s) from AXS Memory Card via Thunderbolt 3 interface.
This makes it easier than ever to import 8K/6K X-OCN files recorded onto AXS
Memory Cards by VENICE 2.

36
CFexpress Type B Memory Card (for BURANO)
BURANO is equipped with two CFexpress Type B memory card slots supporting
VPG400* which can sustain high bitrate writing of video data, including X-OCN LT
8K. The dual media slots allow relay and simultaneous recording**, while versatile
CFexpress Type B media are convenient for backing up and transferring data in the
field.
*Non-VPG CFexpress Type B memory cards are not guaranteed for normal operation
**XAVC only
In 2024, Sony has released new compatible high-capacity models with VPG400,
CEB-G1920T and CEB-G960T. These memory cards have the capacity to reliably
record vast amounts of data such as X-OCN LT 8K, and are also equipped with a high
level of durability that allows them to be used in harsh environment.
Optimized for Sony CFexpress Type B memory cards, the optional card reader
MRW-G1 allows you to transfer data via a USB SuperSpeed 10 Gbps (USB 3.1 Gen
2) interface and take full advantage of high speed backups and more efficient
workflows.
It’s compact, easy to carry and works with both Sony CFexpress Type B and XQD G
series memory cards.

37
Flexible Lens Mount (PL / E)
PL Lens Mount
VENICE 2 and BURANO come with the industry-standard PL lens mount and are
compatible with Super 35mm and Full-Frame PL lenses (spherical and anamorphic).
The lens mount includes contacts that support Cooke /i Technology (including new
generation Cooke /i3*), and lens information is recorded as metadata, frame by
frame. We have also added support for ZEISS eXtended Data*.
*Supported by VENICE 2 only (not by BURANO)
There are two connectors on the side of the lens adaptor. You can use either
connector depending on the shooting configuration – so that the scale of the lens
can be visible by an assistant camera when the camera is installed in a rotated
position of 90 degrees, for example.
Before attaching a lens, set the interface position of the PL Mount lens in the menu
[PL-Mt Interface Position] – [Top], [Side] or [Off]*.
*Select [Off] when using a lens which does not have a Cooke type connector

38
VENICE 2 has a safety mechanism in order to minimize the risk of any troubles
caused by electric short – when attaching a PL Mount lens to the camera.
When no lens is attached, the camera supplies 8V power via the connector. When a
PL Mount lens is attached, the 8V power keeps being supplied during initial
communication between the camera and the lens. Once it’s completed, the supplied
power goes up to 24V to start normal communication. This is the behavior when the
menu [PL-Mt Voltage] is set to [8V->24V] (default value).
However, there may be some cases where the initial communication is not
established correctly due to undervoltage – resulting in no value on the focal length
of the lens displayed on the viewfinder / monitor screen.
In this case, please change the menu setting of [PL-Mt Voltage] to [24V].

39
Lever Lock Type E-mount
E-mount lenses can be fitted when the PL mount adapter is removed – simply by
loosening six hex screws.
The lever lock type E-mount gives users the ability to change lenses by rotating the
locking collar rather than the lens itself, which means that in most cases lens support
rigs don’t need to be removed, saving time during a production.

40
Sony’s ever-increasing range of E-mount lenses, from ultra-wide to ultra-telephoto,
are supported by the BURANO’s advanced image stabilization and AF capabilities –
ideal for mobile and single-operator projects.

Built-in ND Filter
8-step Mechanical ND Filters (for VENICE 2)
VENICE 2 follows the world’s first of VENICE, with a servo-controlled 8-step
Mechanical ND filter mechanism built into the camera chassis.
It consists of two turrets with three glass filters each – that offers a massive ND of
0.3 (1/2 = 1 stop) to 2.4 (1/256 = 8 stops) range that reduces time lost on set
changing external filters.
The ND filters also greatly increase VENICE’s flexibility, such as :
• Ability to be controlled remotely on drones, cranes, or in an underwater housing
• Dust proof by a sealed structure together with grease-less gear mechanism
• Minimized color shifting through individual adjustments made in the factory

42
Electronic Variable ND Filter (for BURANO)
Sony’s unique electronic Variable ND Filter has been redesigned to be both smaller
and compatible with the built-in image stabilization mechanism.
It can smoothly and continuously change its density from 0.6 (1/4) to 2.1 (1/128).
The seamless ND adjustment is available when a PL Mount lens is attached, as well
as an E-mount lens.
With physical ND filters no longer needed, operators can adjust the electronic filter
density by simply rotating the ND dial. Operators can maintain a constant depth of
field by adjusting the electronic ND filter and the iris control together.
Continuous or stepped changes can be selected with the ND STEP/VARIABLE switch,
depending on the application. The [Auto ND] function automatically adjusts the filter
density to give a correct exposure, effectively allowing the use of the ND filter as an
alternative Auto IRIS.

43
Image Stabilization
In-Body Stabilization with PL mount / E-mount lenses (for BURANO)
BURANO is the world’s first cinema camera that supports in-body optical image
stabilization (IBIS) for almost any attached lenses, including for the first time PL. The
new, compact image stabilization system was originally developed for the Alpha
series of mirrorless cameras.
Featuring a gyroscopic sensor and control algorithm, it compensates for camera
shake even for hand-held shooting while walking. The stabilization is so effective that
it removes the need for any extra equipment for many applications.
Stabilization is even greater with E-mount lenses, allowing more difficult shots to be
captured without blurring. Camera shake data can be passed to post-production for
precise alignment with CGI and in volume stages.

**Planned to support on BURANO v2.0 (March 2025 or later)

44
Basically, we would recommend that the menu [Stabilization Adjustment] is set
to [Auto] (default value), so that the image stabilization is performed automatically
based on information obtained from the lens. In the top left of the LCD monitor, the
focal length of the lens is displayed when a lens supporting this information is
attached.
When a lens not supporting this information is attached, no value of the focal length
is displayed. In this case, please select [Manual] in the [Stabilization Adjustment]
menu setting and set the focal length of the lens (8mm to 1000mm) in the [Focal
Length] menu manually to get the optimum level of stabilization.

45
Note
In case of using a Sony E-mount lens equipped with OSS (Optical Steady Shot)
feature, set the slide switch on the lens to [ON] when using Image Stabilization on
the camera. When the switch is set to [OFF], the lens takes priority and the camera
cannot switch the setting.
Image Stabilization feature is designed for hand-held shooting, being optimized for
correction parameters such as the target frequency.
• It is strongly recommended to turn off Image Stabilization when the camera is
used except for hand-held usage – such as drone, in-vehicle, on a tripod and so
on
• Also recommended to turn off Image Stabilization when the footage is used for
VFX, as there may be cases where motion tracking cannot be done accurately
referencing camera metadata
(Also ensure that OSS switch on the lens is set to [OFF] in above cases when an E-
mount lens is used)
For using with a drone system, please ensure precise adjustments suitable for the
weight of camera – on drone, gimbal and damper. Because camera shake tend to
make much bigger impact on drone footage than being equipped with Image
Stabilization mechanism inside the camera.
(These are images on VENICE 2)

46
Auto Focus
Fast Hybrid AF (for BURANO)
Effortlessly track fast moving subjects with pin-sharp focus, even when using wide
lens aperture settings to maintain a shallow depth of field with BURANO’s Full-Frame
sensor.
Originally developed by Sony’s Alpha camera engineers, enhanced Fast Hybrid AF
combines phase detection AF for fast, accurate subject tracking with contrast AF for
exceptional focus accuracy.
The dedicated 627-points phase detection AF sensor covers approximately 88.7% of
the whole image area, allowing consistently accurate, responsive AF tracking, even
with shallow depth of field.

47
AI Subject Recognition AF with touch* (for BURANO)
Our onboard AI processing unit recognizes not only eye position but also accurately
senses human torso and head positions.
Subject Recognition AF automatically draws a frame around people’s faces when they
are detected. Human pose estimation technology recognizes body and head position,
so you can even track a subject facing away from the camera or wearing a mask.
Touch a person to focus on, and the camera will track and that person precisely.
Even in challenging situations like a bowed head or when hair covering a face, the
camera accurately captures the eyes so that operators can focus accurately even in
the most difficult circumstances.
*Over 70 E-mount lenses can use BURANO’s Hybrid AF and AI Subject Recognition AF features

48
VENICE Extension System 2
The VENICE Extension System 2 (CBK-3620XS) allows for new levels of shooting
flexibility with no compromise to image quality.
Incorporating customer feedback and developed alongside VENICE 2, it offers wider
bandwidth to support VENICE 2’s 8K sensor – over twice as much cable distance (up
to 12m) without a repeater box, additional control buttons and a built-in gyro sensor.
The Extension System consists of a front panel cover, image sensor block case with
a choice of 3m and 12m extension cables. The new Extension System is fully
compatible with VENICE 2 using the 8K or 6K sensors – as well as the original VENICE
using latest firmware.

49
The imager block also comes with Monitor output and 24V output for powering
accessories such as lens servo motors and monitoring. The relayed monitor signal
and supplied 24V power need to be input to the camera body respectively.
Multiple screw holes on all surfaces make it easy to accessorize and fit on to a wide
variety of rigs, while the main weight of the camera can be supported elsewhere.
Ideal for shooting in tight spaces and with gimbals
The Extension System camera head measures 158 x 147 x 126 mm (H x W x D)*,
weighing around 2.2 kg* with a PL mount adaptor and 1.7kg* with E-mount when
used with the VENICE 2 8K sensor block.
The separated sensor block with lens is so small and light it allows for an easy hand-
held mode, enabling you to locate it in tiny spaces, keeps stabilization systems
lightweight, allows use of larger lenses while maintaining a smaller profile, facilitates
faster operation for motion-control rigs, use of body mounts, and other situations
that you wouldn’t expect possible for a Full-Frame cinema camera.
*Excluding cable section

PL mount 2.1 kg 2.1 kg
E-mount 1.7 kg 1.6 kg

50
Gyroscopic support with recording to metadata
While shooting with the original Extension System (CBK-3610XS) did not
accommodate use of a spirit level indicator (gyroscope sensor), the CBK-3620XS is
equipped with a sensor on the camera head side that detects horizontal and vertical
tilt.
Camera head tilt information can be checked when shooting at different head and
tilt angles – ideal for VFX applications. Naturally, the horizontal and vertical tilt are
also recorded in the metadata and output through the camera’s SDI.
4 assignable buttons on camera head for easy operation
The camera head has four ASSIGN buttons that can be set to functions such as
change ND filter settings, REC Start/Stop and more for easier operation with VENICE
2. Choose a custom set-up that suits your preference for any scene.

51
High-speed interface, SLVS-EC (Scalable Low-Voltage Signaling with
Embedded Clock) was developed by Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation
(SSS) for fast, high-resolution image sensors.
The interface’s simple protocol makes it easy to build camera systems. Featuring an
embedded clock signal, it is ideal for applications that require high speed, fewer lanes,
or transmission over longer distances.

Remote Camera Control over Ethernet / Wi-Fi (for VENICE 2)
You can fully control a VENICE 2 camera over Ethernet or Wi-Fi* from a tablet or
laptop using a web browser. This allows the first AC or DIT to check and control
every aspect of the camera’s recording and other functions from a safe distance
including changing ISO, frame rates, 8-step ND Filters.
*Requires Wireless LAN adaptor (CBK-WA02) inserted into the camera via USB

57
Using Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection, 3D LUT files, ART files and ASC CDL files can all
be imported directly onto cameras, so there’s no need to physically load them using
SD cards.
ASC CDLs can then be controlled and adjusted* via a web interface and embedded
in clip metadata. This eliminates the need for a DIT to manage ASC CDL files
separately to be associated to the clips in post-production.
*Color wheel control is not supported0

58
In-Camera VFX
Virtual Production makes it possible to replace traditional greenscreen and
bluescreen composing and physical sets by using seamless LED walls as a backdrop,
with the added benefit of capturing final pixel in camera.
Color fidelity of In-Camera VFX
In Virtual Production stage, we can face a potential challenge on color discrepancies
between physical lights and spectrum of LED wall. In order to compensate color
fidelity especially skin tone, VENICE 2 Version 3.0 update introduces the “In-Camera
VFX (ICVFX) Mode”.

59
This setting includes parameters such as “LED Wall Color Temperature” and “Light
Blending” ratio to enhance color fidelity when mixing practical lighting and LED
volumes as lighting in In-Camera VFX. These setting parameters are recorded as
metadata on X-OCN and baked into ProRes.

60
Sony’s Virtual Production Tool Set integrates Crystal LED walls with cinema
cameras for an end-to-end solution. Cinematographers and directors can blend real
sets and props with virtual backdrops to create new worlds and explore their vision.
Camera and Display Plugin
Visualizing the on-set image in advance is
hard and expensive. Reproducing that
image during the shoot is even harder.
Our plugin lets you design the picture you
need for your VENICE-powered virtual
production, then save these settings in our
Virtual VENICE for Unreal Engine.
Let your Virtual Art Department create
pre-visualizations that reflect the reality of
your upcoming shooting with VENICE and LED volume. Share them with your on-set
team for a smoother shoot and less issues while being in the on-set stage.
Transfer the defined parameters to your physical VENICE camera, preserving your
creative vision. Monitor and control your VENICE settings via a simple GUI on Unreal
Engine. Benefit from rea-time moiré alerts for the shoot.
Color Calibrator
Calibrate the colors for your virtual
production before you start to shoot, for
more efficient shooting and less work in
post-production. Solve LED color shifts in
advance so you don’t need to deal with it
on shoot days.
Precise color reproduction can be
challenging for virtual productions,
creating unnecessary adjustments on-set
and corrections at post-production. Color Calibrator is a Windows 10 application
which is specially tuned to our VENICE cinema camera, so you can ensure that the
colors you visualize before the shoot day match the colors that will appear in your
dailies.

61
Display the color calibration chart on your LED volume, using the Sony Onset Camera
Component (found in our Camera and Display Plugin for Unreal Engine).
Color Calibrator analyses and compares the calibration charts from within Unreal
Engine and the image that the VENICE camera captures from the panels. It then
automatically shows the difference with a graph and vector scope.
Easily Create and output a LUT correction, which is applied to Unreal Engine to adjust
colors.

4K HDR On-set Monitoring
With directors, first ACs, cinematographers and DITs needing to work remotely from
the camera and each other, best-in-class, virtually precise and consistent monitoring
is all the more important to identify hot spots or how much detail is being recorded
in the shadows, as well as extraneous items in shot.
Launched in 2020, the affordable PVM-X2400 (24”) and PVM-X1800 (18.4”)
TRIMASTER 4K HDR monitors are designed for on-set use. The PVM-X range
perfectly matches the wide color gamut of the Sony BVM-HX3110, BVM-HX310 and
BVM-X300 monitors – as widely used throughout high-end post – and shares the
same, familiar menus and functions. These monitors also bring all-white luminance
of 1000 cd/㎡* to production monitoring across a wide range of applications.
*Panel specification. This is a typical luminance value at D65 but not guaranteed.
The PVM-X range monitors are compact, light, extremely portable and can run off
batteries making them easier to deploy within stand-alone workstations. They can
also be used for super-accurate on-set dailies and by WIP editorial wanting an
affordable but highly accurate 4K HDR image to work from.

64
Offload & Backup
Once a shooting is finished, the camera data need to be transferred from memory
cards to a storage (e.g. HDD). Rather than using simple file copy methods (e.g.
macOS Finder or Windows Explorer), a data management tool is used in order to
ensure the secure transfer.
Sony X-OCN files are supported by leading data management tools for secure
handling and verification of original camera data – such as Pomfort Silverstack,
Yoyotta, Hedge OffShoot, and ShotPut Pro from Imagine Products.
For reference, the following example shows a typical folder structure of original
camera data in X-OCN / XAVC* format, recorded on a memory card by VENICE 2 or
BURANO. There are slight differences between the two models.
*Supported by BURANO only (not by VENICE 2)
X-OCN Folder Structure (VENICE 2)
• The root folder is called “CINEROOT”, but once the first recording is made the
folder is renamed as a unique name (e.g. “A001CRWE” in below chart)
• An X-OCN file (.mxf) is recorded under “Clip” folder, in an individual folder for
each clip
• A Non Real-Time Metadata file (.xml) is recorded in the individual folder for
each clip as a side-car file of the X-OCN file
 “M01” is added at the end of clip name
• A 3D LUT file (.cube) is recorded in the individual folder for each clip as a side-
car file of the X-OCN file, if 3D LUT is applied to the monitoring image
 Look->CDL* : “L01” is added at the end of clip name
 CDL->Look* : “L02” is added at the end of clip name
*depends on [ASC CDL Process] menu setting
• An ASC CDL file (.cdl) is recorded in the individual folder for each clip as a side-
car file of the X-OCN file, if ASC CDL is applied to the monitoring image
 “D01” is added at the end of clip name

65
X-OCN Folder Structure (BURANO)
• The root folder is called “CINEROOT”, but once the first recording is made the
folder is renamed as a unique name
• An X-OCN file (.mxf) is recorded under “Clip” folder, in an individual folder for
each clip
• A Non Real-Time Metadata file (.xml) is recorded in the individual folder for
each clip as a side-car file of the X-OCN file
 “M01” is added at the end of clip name
• 3D LUT files (.cube) are not recorded in X-OCN recording*
• ASC CDL is not supported on BURANO

66
XAVC Folder Structure (BURANO)
• The root folder name and the volume label name of the recording media can be
selected on the [XAVC Root Folder Name] menu setting :
 [XDROOT] (default name)
 [Cam ID + Reel#] : Camera ID (1-digit) + Reel No. (3-digit)
• An XAVC file (.mxf) is recorded under “Clip” folder, in an individual folder for
each clip
• A Non Real-Time Metadata file (.xml) is recorded in the individual folder for
each clip as a side-car file of the X-OCN file
 “M01” is added at the end of clip name
• 3D LUT files (.cube) are recorded under “General/LUT” folder if 3D LUT is
applied to the monitoring image*
• ASC CDL is not supported on BURANO
*The 3D LUT information can also be recorded as metadata in the XAVC clip, when the [Embed LUT
File] menu is set to [ON]

67
Safe Memory Card Eraser
o/PARASHOOT is a safe card eraser application* with backup verification and file
restore, offered by OTTOMATIC. The version 2 officially supports Sony AXS Memory
Card – which means it works perfectly in VENICE workflow.
*for macOS platform only
This background application watches over your selected backup destination folder.
When you format a memory card after a backup, o/PARASHOOT verifies file names
and file sizes to be identical to the backup destination. If files in the backup
destination folder are missing, o/PARASHOOT won’t allow you to format the card and
you will be prompted to manually re-check the backup or to back up missing files.
If the backup is identical, o/PARASHOOT fake formats the card to make it unreadable
by any camera or file system. This allows the camera assistant to format the card on
insertion into the camera without going through the menu, as most cameras prompt
you to reformat a mal-formed card. Up until then, the fake-formatting allows to
restore the card completely without loss of information.
This workflow makes sure a camera assistant knows that the card was backed up by
a DIT and verified by o/PARASHOOT.

68
The following tools are required to be used together in this workflow :
• o/PARASHOOT v2 or later (application software)
• Sony AXSM Drive Utility v3.3.0 or later (application software)
• Sony AXS-AR3 or AXS-AR1 v1.20 or later (AXS Memory card reader)

69
Data Recovery
AXS Memory Card (for VENICE 2) :
VENICE 2 recording system adopts AXS Memory Card (A Series) that is an ultra-high
speed, high capacity and high reliability flash memory card – perfectly suited to the
highest quality cinematography.
In order to avoid any troubles that require some data recovery recorded on AXS
Memory Card, we would strongly recommend the followings :
1. When storing or carrying AXS Memory Cards, please ensure keeping the
card in the supplied case and make sure the case is locked securely
If AXS Memory Card is subjected to a large external shock such as being
dropped from a high place, the internal circuit board may be damaged and
recorded data may be affected in the worst-case scenario.
If an AXS Memory Card cannot be mounted on Mac (via AXS Memory Card
Reader) due to physical damage or some other reason, please try Windows
PC instead in order to offload the clips.
(Because it tends to be more successful for AXS Memory Cards to be mounted
on Windows PC compared to Mac in such cases)

70
2. Please keep firmware & software up-to-date on all the working machines
& apps
The latest versions include some improvements in terms of stability.

Camera (VENICE 2 / VENICE + AXS-R7)
When turning off the power or removing the card, please ensure that the
ACCESS lamp of the card slot in use is lit in green (or unlit) before proceeding.
Note
• If the power of this device is turned off or the memory card is removed while
accessing the memory card, data cannot be guaranteed
• There is a possibility that all data recorded on the card may become corrupted

71
Memory Card Reader (AXS-AR3 / AR1)
After inserting the card, it will be lit in blue until it is recognized (Please do not
remove the memory card during this time).
Once it is recognized properly, the access lamp will light up green for standby
(Please do not remove the memory card during this time).
Before removing the card, please perform the safe removal operation for the
memory card reader on macOS or Windows. Once the removal operation is
complete, the access lamp will turn off indicating that it is safe to remove the
memory card.
Note (for AXS-AR3 / AR1 / CR1)
• For instance, in the event that the power is lost during recording, internal
processing is occasionally performed automatically after inserting the card into a
card reader – which may result in a delay before the Mac/PC recognizes the card.
Please wait for a moment without removing the card.
• If the card is not recognized even after the following time has elapsed, please
remove the card and insert again.
 AXS-A1TS48 / AXS-A512S48 : approx. 7 seconds
 AXS-A1TS66 : approx. 15 seconds
• If the power of this device is turned off or the memory card is removed while
accessing the memory card, data cannot be guaranteed
• There is a possibility that all data recorded on the card may become corrupted

72
However if for any reason an error should occur in an AXS Memory Card, the card
must be restored* before use. When some troubles happen during recording (e.g.
camera powered down), we would suggest the following procedure to try the
recovery.
*Not guaranteed that all clips / cards are restored or recovered
#1 “Restore” function on the camera
1) When the power is turned on again, the following message is displayed on the
sub display.
(The same message may be displayed when the card is re-inserted, after the
card is removed and the camera is turned on again)
2) Select “Run” to execute the restore.
Note
• Be sure to try the Restore function on the camera that was used for recording.
• The card that was recorded with a camera other than the one that was used for
recording or with another unit of different version (even if the same model) may not
be restored properly.

73
#2 “Clip Recovery” function on AXSM Drive Utility
If the recovery 1) is not successful, try this function on the application software.
A) Recovering clip files stored on an AXS Memory Card
If a clip file that requires recovery exists on the card selected in the tree display,
you can recover that file and save it on a computer.
Note
• This function does not perform recovery of an AXS Memory Card itself.
• This operation will not delete the original files from before the recovery was performed.
Recovery clip files will be saved to a folder that you specify on the computer.
Be sure to verify whether there is sufficient space on the storage (e.g. HDD) to which
the clip files will be saved beforehand.
B) Recovering clip files stored on a computer
If clip files transferred from an AXS Memory Card to a computer require recovery,
you can perform recovery based on the transferred files.
Note
• This operation will not delete the original files from before the recovery was
performed. The recovered clip files will be saved to the same folder as the clip files
that required recovery.
Be sure to verify whether there is sufficient space on the storage (e.g. HDD)
containing the clip files beforehand.

CFexpress Card Type B (for BURANO) :
BURANO recording system adopts CFexpress Card (Type B) VPG400 that allows for
reliable capture at exceptional high data rates, including X-OCN LT recording in full
8K. The versatile media are convenient for backing up and transferring data in the
field.
Just like VENICE 2, the Restore function on the camera is also available for BURANO.
“Restore” function on the camera
1) When you load a CFexpress Card that needs to be restored, the following
message appears on the LCD monitor to ask whether you want to restore it.
“Media Error – Media (A) Needs to be Restored …”
2) Select “Execute” to execute the restore.
Note
• For restoration of media recorded with this unit, be sure to use this unit.
• Media recorded with a device other than this unit or with another unit of different
version (even of the same model) may not be restored using this unit.
• Clips shorter than 2 seconds cannot be restored.
• Restored media may not operate at its original performance. Make a backup of all
required clips and then execute a full format before use.

Viewing & Transcoding
RAW Viewer
RAW Viewer is free application software that allows you to view RAW, X-OCN and
XAVC files recorded with Sony VENICE 2, VENICE, BURANO and other cameras as
well as AXS-R7 recorder.
With its intuitive user interface, you can view and perform basic color grading on files
transferred to your computer, or files stored on a memory card inserted to AXS-AR3
or other card reader.
In addition, you can also export RAW, X-OCN, XAVC and ProRes files to DPX,
OpenEXR, XAVC or ProRes (for macOS only) format to facilitate file based post-
production workflow.
The camera metadata is preserved during file conversion to OpenEXR, which can
help post-production operators especially in VFX workflow.

77
Offline Editing & Re-link
X-OCN Workflow Overview
For offline editing workflow, all X-OCN files are usually transcoded to lower resolution
proxy files such as ProRes and DNxHD.
Sony RAW Viewer supports this transcoding to ProRes files (for macOS only). If
necessary, you can also use another application software called Sony Catalyst
Prepare which supports transcoding to DNxHD as well.
These tools can be useful in environments where other transcoding software is not
available.

78
X-OCN Clip Name Structure
In the re-link process during conforming, it is extremely important to match the clip
name between proxy and original high-res X-OCN files.
The consistent clip naming rule is adopted on VENICE 2 and BURANO as follows.
VENICE 2 offers two options in terms of handling Camera ID – Single digit (Type A)
or Double digit sacrificing Camera Position (Type B).
BURANO supports Single digit (Type A) only.

79
Delivery Format (Frame Line)
Before starting to shoot, it is important to define the final target format ensuring
between production and post-production teams – in order to avoid any issues during
post-production process.
VENICE 2 supports Frame Line feature, which help us frame correctly with the
camera on set.
User Frame Line display
You can select whether to display arbitrarily configured user frame lines or a fixed
aspect ratio. User Frame Line 1 and User Frame Line 2 can be set for user frame
lines.
• To set user-configured lines, select “Variable” in the menu and specify the Width,
Height, H Position, V Position and Variable Aspect Type
• To set a fixed aspect ratio, select “Preset” in the menu and specify the Preset
Aspect Ratio, Scaling and Preset Aspect Ratio Type
Assignable button operations
You can show/hide User Frame Line 1 and User Frame Line 2 configured for Line A
by assigning Line A: User Frame Disp. to some of assignable buttons and ITEM keys
1 to 5. (similarly for Line B)
Each time the assignable button is pressed, the display switches between :
User Frame line 1 and 2 display  User Frame Line 1 display
 User Frame Line 2 Display  User Frame Line 1 and 2 hidden
You can also show/hide Aspect Ratio configured for Line A or Line B by assigning
Line A: Aspect Ratio Disp. or Line B: Aspect Ratio Disp. to some of assignable buttons
and ITEM keys 1 to 5.
Each time the assignable button is pressed, the display switchers between :
Aspect Ratio display  Aspect Ratio hidden

80

81
Displaying Frame Line files created using Sony’s Frame Line Tool
Sony’s Frame Line Tool is an online interactive tool to create Frame Line configuration
files to upload to your camera. To use this tool :
1. Select the camera model for 6K or 8K sensor
2. Select or upload a preview image for reference
3. Setup the desired frame lines and center target
4. Export the XML settings file
Frame Line Tool (
https://pro.sony/frame-line-tool)
The XML file needs to be saved in the following directory on SD card.
MPC-3628: PRIVATE/SONY/PRO/CAMERA/MPC3628
MPC-3626: PRIVATE/SONY/PRO/CAMERA/MPC3626
By loading the XML file from SD card to VENICE 2 camera, you can save the Frame
Line files in internal memory and then apply the data to User Frame Line 1 and 2.
You can also perform the configuration from the web remote control full menu.

COLOR GRADING & VFX
• ACES Workflow
• HDR Workflow
• VFX Workflow

83
ACES Workflow
The Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) is the industry standard for managing
color throughout the life cycle of a motion picture or television production. From
image capture through editing, VFX, mastering, public presentation, archiving and
future remastering, ACES ensures a consistent color experience that preserves the
filmmaker’s creative vision.
ACES is a free, open, device-independent color management and image interchange
system that can be applied to almost any current or future workflow. It was
developed by hundreds of the industry’s top scientists, engineers and end users,
working together under the auspices of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences (AMPAS).
Sony has worked closely with the Academy to develop and test various
implementations of ACES leading up to Version 1.0. As a member of the ACES Logo
Program, Sony is committed to its cameras, related products and solutions
supporting ACES-based workflows in the highest quality possible.

84
VENICE 2 provides a capability to select [ACEScct] in the [Input Color Space] menu
setting for ACES workflow (which is not available on original VENICE). It allows to
preview the footage on set, even during live color grading – with exactly the same
“look” as what is used during color grading in post-production.
As [Preset Look] setting, you can select [ACESproxy] or [ACEScct] depending on the
workspace used on a color grading tool in post-production. [ACES 1.0 Output-
Rec.709] can also be set for ACEScct workflow using in-camera color adjustment
(CDL) and transform to Rec.709.
Preset Look Select :
• [ACESproxy] : Log curve of wide color space (AP1) defined by the Academy
• [ACEScct] : Log curve of wide color space (AP1) based on ACESproxy, with toe
characteristic that reduces contrast in the curve near black
• [ACES 1.0 Output-Rec.709] : Rec.709 reference Look defined by the Academy

85
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

86
BURANO also offers the same ACES workflow as VENICE 2, allowing to select the
same base looks – [ACESproxy], [ACEScct] or [ACES 1.0 Ouput-Rec.709].
The difference from VENICE 2 is that the above base looks can be selected when
[Color Gamut] in the Project menu is set to [S-Gamut3/S-Log3] (meaning there is
no [ACEScct] option in the Color Gamut).
An Input Device Transform (IDT) processes original camera data in the form of
non-color-rendered RGB image values from a captured scene lit by an assumed
illumination source (the scene adopted white) and converts them to ACES RGB
relative exposure values in a scene linear color space.
The IDT files on Sony CineAlta cameras are available to download from this page 
on
ACES Central website (acescentral.com).

87
In addition, Sony’s RAW Viewer application software also supports ACES workflow.
You can perform the following based on ACES 1.3 :
• Converting camera content to ACES color space and exporting to ACES
Container (Scene-Linear OpenEXR)
• Color grading in ACES working space
• Monitoring and file output using ACES viewing pipeline

88
HDR Workflow
With the widespread adoption of HDR-ready displays and the expansion of OTT
streaming, the demand for HDR production has clearly increased. In the process of
producing HDR footage, it is essential to ensure that the material is captured with a
wide dynamic range and color gamut.
Sony would recommend S-Gamut3/S-Log3 that is supported not only by Sony
CineAlta (VENICE 2 / BURANO) cameras, but also by other Cinema Line / Alpha
cameras – due to the following reasons. It has widely been used for HDR workflow
even as a working space of Color Grading process in post-production.
• To fully and adequately utilize the performance of the image sensor
• To maintain the quality even when handling a wide dynamic range, minimizing
the degradation of image quality during the finishing process conversion
• S-Gamut3 is a color space that is highly compatible with ACES (AP1) / Rec.2020
(rather than S-Gamut3.Cine)
Using ACES is another option as a standard in the industry (as explained in the
previous section).
Even if the footage is captured with S-Gamut3/S-Log3, most of color grading tools
can handle this S-Gamut3/S-Log3 converting to ACEScct easily. Based on ACES
workflow, various deliverables are created through Output Transform.

89
VFX Workflow
For visual effects work or contents creation for giant screen, we would recommend
X-OCN XT mode as recording format*. This is ideal as it captures the highest quality
imagery.
*supported by VENICE 2 only (not by BURANO)
S-Gamut3.Cine/S-Log3 or S-Gamut3/S-Log3 can be used for shooting, as most of
current workflow can handle those color spaces in their color management system
in post-production – converting to ACES color space easily, if necessary.
Sony RAW Viewer is also one of the useful tools in VFX workflow due to the following
reasons :
• Capability to convert X-OCN to OpenEXR, while preserving all the camera & lens
metadata completely
• All the camera & lens metadata (including Tilt/Roll** gyro data) can be exported
as CSV file
**RAW Viewer v5.0 (or later) is required
When shooting with BURANO in VFX workflow, Image Stabilization feature should be
set to OFF (disabled). Because if this feature is activated, the optical axis in the
recorded image moves continuously. Accordingly, the recorded metadata is also not
useful for VFX process in post-production.

Metadata (X-OCN)
X-OCN is a very easy and flexible format to work with Metadata that reflects the
setup of the camera is recorded alongside the image information.
In post-production this metadata is automatically applied to the 16-bit linear
recordings so that what you see in the edit or grading suite accurately reflects the
way the camera was set. However, in post-production you can override the metadata
settings for color temperature, Exposure Index and sharpness etc* to alter the way
the data is processed.
This gives a tremendous degree of flexibility while retaining the exceptional quality
of the 16-bit recording.
*The controls available depends on the software used
The following information is a list of metadata recorded as embedded in X-OCN MXF
files, as well as recorded in XML files at the same time on the camera :
